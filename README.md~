This is the template code to be used for the rat project (and your mouse, if you'd like!) for UCLA Micromouse. Here are the basic steps to using the template:

* Download this repository to your computer.
* Create new program in mbed.
* Create two folders in the mbed program: "src" and "headers"
* Open the "src" folder in mbed by clicking it on the left sidebar. Then, drag all the files in the downloaded "src" folder (so, the "src" folder in the git repo you downloaded) into the mbed compiler.
* Follow the same steps for the "header" folders.

Now you should be all set to use the template. Also provided are helpful pieces of example code. Some of these fit into the lecture, some are standalone things. Be aware of what is in this folder, so that you can check whenver you need guidance.
