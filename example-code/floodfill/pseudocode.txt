if there is a neighbor with lower distance to the center,
    move to that neighbor

// otherwise, must run floodfill
initialize new stack
push current location onto stack

while stack is not empty:
    cur = stack.pop()

    // Do not process end goal
    // cur.distance is distance from "cur" cell to center of maze
    if cur.distance == 0, continue

    min_dist = inf // or any big number
    for each neighboring cell of cur,
        if there is no wall between cur and neighbor,
            min_dist = neighbor.distance
    
    // Means that "cur" has a smaller distance cell it can move to,
    // so no need to do anything else
    if cur.distance > min_dist,
        continue
    
    cur.distance = min_dist + 1
    push every neighbor onto the stack
